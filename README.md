## Overview

The credit risk modeling project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the loan applicant data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and more.

2. Model Training: Train various machine learning models to predict credit risk, including logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, gradient boosting, random forests, neural networks, and naive Bayes.

3. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
